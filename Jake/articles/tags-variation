<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>@variation &lt;variationNumber&gt;</code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Sometimes your code may include multiple symbols with the same longname. For example, you might have
both a global class and a top-level namespace called <code>Widget</code>. In cases such as these,
what does "{@link Widget}" or "@memberof Widget" mean? The global namespace, or the global class?
</p>

<p>
Variations help JSDoc distinguish between different symbols with the same longname. For example, if
"@variation 2" is added to the JSDoc comment for the Widget class, "{@link Widget(2)}" will refer to
the class, and "{@link Widget}" will refer to the namespace. Alternatively, you can include the
variation when you specify the symbol's with tags such as <a href="tags-alias.html">@alias</a> or
<a href="tags-name.html">@name</a> (for example, "@alias Widget(2)").
</p>

<p>
You can provide any value with the @variation tag, as long as the combination of the value and the
longname results in a globally unique version of the longname. As a best practice, use a predictable
pattern for choosing the values, which will make it easier for you to document your code.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
The following example uses the @variation tag to distinguish between the Widget class and the Widget
namespace.
</p>

{{#example}}Using the @variation tag
/**
 * The Widget namespace.
 * @namespace Widget
 */

// you can also use '@class Widget(2)' and omit the @variation tag
/**
 * The Widget class. Defaults to the properties in {@link Widget.properties}.
 * @class
 * @variation 2
 * @param {Object} props - Name-value pairs to add to the widget.
 */
function Widget(props) {}

/**
 * Properties added by default to a new {@link Widget(2)} instance.
 */
Widget.properties = {
	/**
	 * Indicates whether the widget is shiny.
	 */
	shiny: true,
	/**
	 * Indicates whether the widget is metallic.
	 */
	metallic: true
};
