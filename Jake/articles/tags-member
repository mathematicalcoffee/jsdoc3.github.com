<h3>Syntax</h3>
<code>@member [&lt;type&gt;] [&lt;name&gt;]</code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The @member tag identifies any member that does not have a more specialized kind, such as "class",
"function", or "constant". A member can optionally have a type as well as a name. 
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

{{#example}}Using @member with Data#point
/** @class */
function Data() {
    /** @member {Object} */
    this.point = {};
}
{{/example}}

<p>Here is an example of using @var, a synonym of @member, to document a (virtual) variable 'foo'.
</p>

{{#example}}Using @member to document a virtual member
/**
 * A variable in the global namespace called 'foo'.
 * @var {number} foo
 */
{{/example}}

<p>The above example is equivalent to the following:</p>

{{#example}} 
/**
 * A variable in the global namespace called 'foo'.
 * @type {number}
 */
var foo;
{{/example}}
